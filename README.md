# ShrimpGrad
## A shrimp sized neural network autograd engine

First shrimp grad is shrimp sized. Prior art used for insipiration and learning are micrograd from A. Karpathy and tinygrad from G. Hotz.

Initially will work with only with Scalar values. Then will move to Tensors. The idea is to write low-level Zig to implement the speedy ops.
